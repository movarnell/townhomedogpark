# Testing
Jest testing is probably a better setup than mocha/chai. Having tests in general is my go to sign of a "professional" developer. Of course this depends on the seriousness of the project, but if your goal is to simulate a "real app" then it should have tests. Let me know if you want some help with adding some.

# Stripping out Create React App
I started with React before `CreateReactApp` really caught on. I've used it occassionally to get something running to play with, but when it comes to deploying to production you probably want to strip out the _development bulk_. I will also admit my ignorance of how to best utilize something like `reportWebVitals`.
